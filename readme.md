# TrumpCard/Super hero fighting game

This is a game that I was tasked with writing during the first year of my Computer Science course at QUB.

It is written according to the spec in ``docs/``.

You can open the project using IntelliJ Idea in order to build it. This project is written in Java and requires at least Java 8 as I have used some new features only available in that version, for example: anonymous methods.
